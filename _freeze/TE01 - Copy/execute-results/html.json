Categorical variables stored as numeric codes in the raw survey (e.g., Year, Gender, GPA, time-use variables) were converted into labelled factor variables to improve readability and interpretation in plots. This ensures that axis labels display meaningful categories rather than numeric codes.\n\nIn addition, all Likert-scale perception items (1–5 scale) were explicitly converted to numeric values using as.integer() to enable quantitative operations such as proportion calculations and correlation analysis. These transformations standardise the dataset structure and ensure compatibility with ggplot2 and subsequent statistical procedures.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- df_raw %>%\n  mutate(\n    Year = factor(Year, levels = 1:5,\n                  labels = c(\"1st year\",\"2nd year\",\"3rd year\",\"4th year\",\"Graduated\")),\n    Gender = factor(Gender, levels = c(1,2), labels = c(\"Male\",\"Female\")),\n    Time_SocicalMedia = factor(Time_SocicalMedia, levels = 1:5,\n                               labels = c(\"<1h\",\"1–<2h\",\"2–<3h\",\"3–<4h\",\">=4h\")),\n    Time_Studying = factor(Time_Studying, levels = 1:5,\n                           labels = c(\"<2h\",\"2–<4h\",\"4–<6h\",\"6–<8h\",\">=8h\")),\n    GPA = factor(GPA, levels = 1:5,\n                 labels = c(\"<2.0\",\"2.0–<2.5\",\"2.5–<3.2\",\"3.2–<3.6\",\">=3.6\")),\n    across(c(Adapt_Learning_Uni, Study_Methods, SupportOf_Uni, SupportOf_Lec,\n             Facilitie_Uni, Quality_Lecturer, TrainingCurriculum,\n             Competitive_Class, InfuenceF_Friends),\n           ~ as.integer(.x))\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_likert_stack <- function(data, var, title) {\n  data %>%\n    count(resp = .data[[var]]) %>%\n    mutate(\n      resp = factor(resp, levels = 1:5,\n                    labels = c(\"1 Not at all\",\"2 Little\",\"3 Moderate\",\"4 Quite\",\"5 Very\")),\n      pct = n / sum(n)\n    ) %>%\n    ggplot(aes(x = 1, y = pct, fill = resp)) +\n    geom_col(width = 0.6) +\n    coord_flip() +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n    labs(title = title, x = NULL, y = \"Share\", fill = NULL) +\n    theme_minimal()\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n---\n\n## 4.0 EDA\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Visualization 1 — GPA distribution {.tabset}\n\n### Code\n\n```r\np1_gpa <- df %>%\n  count(GPA) %>%\n  mutate(pct = n/sum(n)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(GPA, pct)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  labs(title = \"GPA distribution (categorised)\",\n       x = NULL, y = \"Share of students\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\np1_gpa\n```\n\n### Visual\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TE01---Copy_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Observation:**  \nThe GPA distribution is concentrated in the mid-performance range. Most respondents fall within the 2.5–<3.2 and 3.2–<3.6 categories, while only small proportions appear at the lowest and highest ends. This indicates that the cohort largely consists of average-to-good performers rather than extreme achievers. Such a balanced distribution allows behavioural and environmental factors to be meaningfully compared across performance groups. However, the small number of very low and very high GPAs limits the visibility of strong contrasts between extremes. Overall, academic outcomes appear relatively stable across the sample.\n:::\n\n---\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Visualization 2 — Study time vs GPA {.tabset}\n\n### Code\n\n```r\np2_study_gpa <- df %>%\n  count(Time_Studying, GPA) %>%\n  group_by(Time_Studying) %>%\n  mutate(pct = n/sum(n)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(Time_Studying, pct, fill = GPA)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"fill\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  labs(title = \"GPA composition by daily study time\",\n       x = \"Study time per day\", y = \"Share within group\",\n       fill = \"GPA\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\np2_study_gpa\n```\n\n### Visual\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TE01---Copy_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Observation:**  \nStudents who report longer daily study hours generally show a higher share of good and excellent GPA outcomes. Groups studying six hours or more tend to contain relatively more high-performing students, while shorter study durations display a larger proportion of mid-to-lower GPAs. Although the differences are moderate rather than dramatic, the overall pattern suggests that consistent study effort contributes positively to academic performance. This implies that time investment remains an important, though not exclusive, determinant of learning outcomes.\n:::\n\n---\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Visualization 3 — Social media time vs GPA {.tabset}\n\n### Code\n\n```r\np3_social_gpa <- df %>%\n  count(Time_SocicalMedia, GPA) %>%\n  group_by(Time_SocicalMedia) %>%\n  mutate(pct = n/sum(n)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(Time_SocicalMedia, pct, fill = GPA)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"fill\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  labs(title = \"GPA composition by daily social media use\",\n       x = \"Social media time per day\", y = \"Share within group\",\n       fill = \"GPA\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\np3_social_gpa\n```\n\n### Visual\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TE01---Copy_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Observation:**  \nHeavier social media usage is associated with a slightly lower share of strong academic outcomes. Students spending more than three to four hours per day tend to have comparatively fewer high GPAs and relatively more mid-range results. While the relationship is not large, the consistent downward shift suggests that excessive online engagement may compete with study time or concentration. This indicates that digital distractions could have a small but noticeable negative influence on learning performance.\n:::\n\n---\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Visualization 4 — Year of study vs GPA {.tabset}\n\n### Code\n\n```r\np4_year_gpa <- df %>%\n  count(Year, GPA) %>%\n  group_by(Year) %>%\n  mutate(pct = n/sum(n)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(Year, pct, fill = GPA)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"fill\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  labs(title = \"GPA composition by year of study\",\n       x = NULL, y = \"Share within year\",\n       fill = \"GPA\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\np4_year_gpa\n```\n\n### Visual\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TE01---Copy_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Observation:**  \nPerformance patterns vary slightly across academic years. Senior students and graduates generally exhibit a higher proportion of good and excellent GPAs compared with earlier-year students. This may reflect accumulated experience, improved study strategies, and better adaptation to university expectations over time. In contrast, newer students show more mid-range outcomes, possibly due to transitional challenges. The results suggest that academic achievement may improve progressively as students become more familiar with the learning environment.\n:::\n\n---\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Visualization 5 — University vs Lecturer support {.tabset}\n\n### Code\n\n```r\np5_uni_support <- plot_likert_stack(df, \"SupportOf_Uni\", \"Perceived university support\")\np5_lec_support <- plot_likert_stack(df, \"SupportOf_Lec\", \"Perceived lecturer support\")\n\np5_uni_support / p5_lec_support\n```\n\n### Visual\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TE01---Copy_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Observation:**  \nPerceptions of both university and lecturer support are strongly positive, with most responses concentrated in the “Quite” and “Very” supportive categories. Lecturer support appears marginally stronger than institutional support, indicating that direct interaction with teaching staff may have a greater perceived impact on learning. Negative responses are minimal, suggesting that students generally feel well assisted academically and administratively. Such supportive conditions likely contribute to maintaining stable and satisfactory learning outcomes.\n:::\n\n---\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Visualization 6 — Correlation heatmap {.tabset}\n\n### Code\n\n```r\nlikert_vars <- c(\n  \"Adapt_Learning_Uni\",\"Study_Methods\",\"SupportOf_Uni\",\"SupportOf_Lec\",\n  \"Facilitie_Uni\",\"Quality_Lecturer\",\"TrainingCurriculum\",\n  \"Competitive_Class\",\"InfuenceF_Friends\"\n)\n\nnice_labels <- c(\n  \"Adaptation\",\"Study Methods\",\"Uni Support\",\"Lecturer Support\",\n  \"Facilities\",\"Lecturer Quality\",\"Curriculum\",\n  \"Competition\",\"Peer Influence\"\n)\n\ncorr_mat <- df %>%\n  select(all_of(likert_vars)) %>%\n  drop_na() %>%\n  cor(method = \"spearman\")\n\ncolnames(corr_mat) <- nice_labels\nrownames(corr_mat) <- nice_labels\n\ncorr_long <- as.data.frame(as.table(corr_mat)) |>\n  rename(var1 = Var1, var2 = Var2, rho = Freq)\n\np6_corr <- ggplot(corr_long, aes(var1, var2, fill = rho)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  coord_equal() +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"#d73027\", mid = \"white\", high = \"#4575b4\",\n                       midpoint = 0, limits = c(-1,1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Spearman Correlation Among Learning Environment Factors\",\n       x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = \"ρ\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11),\n    panel.grid = element_blank()\n  )\n\np6_corr\n```\n\n### Visual\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TE01---Copy_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Observation:**  \nThe heatmap shows moderate positive relationships among several learning environment factors. Adaptation, effective study methods, and lecturer quality tend to move together, indicating that these aspects reinforce one another. Students perceiving strong teaching quality also report better adjustment and learning behaviours. However, correlations are not excessively high, suggesting each factor contributes uniquely to outcomes. Overall, academic performance appears to be shaped by multiple interconnected yet distinct elements of the learning experience rather than any single dominant driver.\n:::\n",
